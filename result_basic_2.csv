695,Compression

697,The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression.
698,In the context of data transmission-COMMA- it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.
699,Compression
700,Because compressed data must be decompressed to use-COMMA- this extra processing imposes computational or other costs through decompression; this situation is far from being a free lunch.
701,Data
702,The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors-COMMA- including the degree of compression-COMMA- the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression)-COMMA- and the computational resources required to compress and decompress the data.

722,There is a close connection between machine learning and compression: a system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution) while an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best-COMMA- given the previous history).
723,LPC
724,This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for general intelligence.
725,This is the same as considering absolute entropy (corresponding to data compression) as a special case of relative entropy (corresponding to data differencing) with no initial data.

3021,The septa of such species also enable them to change the shapes of individual segments-COMMA- which facilitates movement by peristalsis (ripples that pass along the body) or by undulations that improve the effectiveness of the parapodia.
3022,These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer; for example-COMMA- in some the females collect sperm released into the water-COMMA- while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female.

3029,The burrowing of marine polychaetes-COMMA- which may constitute up to a third of all species in near-shore environments-COMMA- encourages the development of ecosystems by enabling water and oxygen to penetrate the sea floor.

3056,The setae (hairs) of annelids project out from the epidermis to provide traction and other capabilities.
3057,In active crawlers and swimmers the parapodia are often divided into large upper and lower paddles on a very short trunk-COMMA- and the paddles are generally fringed with chetae and sometimes with cirri (fused bundles of cilia) and gills.

3124,Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface-COMMA- generally in moist leaf litter.
3125,The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it-COMMA- and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter-COMMA- by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms-COMMA- and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily.
